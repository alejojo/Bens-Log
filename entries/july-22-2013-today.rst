10 Hours Previously
-------------------
Stayed up too late reading *Wild Fermentation* and decided at midnight to make a sourdough starter. This morning there were probably about a dozen bubbles, surprisingly.

Morning Ride
------------
Weather was cool this morning. Dense fog covering tall buildings downtown. Some runner waved at me and a homeless person let me pass. Otherwise uneventful and efficient ride. Rested for 10 minutes at destination, only mildly sweaty. Not sore from leg day at gym. Glad today is a rest day.

I just realized I was a day off in my previous two posts. Too lazy to fix. Going forward will probably be correct.

Morning
-------
Stirred sourdough starter. I think it might have gone completely sour. Smells rather strongly and the flour separates from the water somewhat and floats to the top. We shall see. I'm currently adding 2tbs a day to it.

Ride was straight up cold. Nose ran the entire time. Clear skies but a little damp near the river. Sunlight blinding going east through downtown. Same guy waved at me this morning in the same place on the trail. I hope I see that guy every day.

Morning
-------
Cold again this morning. Decided to wear my wind breaker (a thin golf jacket I got from the thrift store). Warm but not stifling. Good ride, felt a little slow. Same guy waved at me this morning. Rode through an amazing amount of geese, two of which hissed at me. I hate geese. Ate my last Japanese pancake this morning, which saddens me. Back to the old yogurt+pb+granola routine.

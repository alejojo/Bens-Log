Sourdough and kimchi coming along nicely. Kimchee starting to taste good. Have been eating a Japanese pancake for breakfast. At about 400 calories, I eat that and have a glass of water.

Morning Ride
------------
Ride was rather cool this morning. Always feel bad when passing other cyclists on a bike. I don't know why. Rode in way too high a gear up the Broad St hill from the river. Otherwise uneventful.

Evening
-------
Met with pastor that is going to marry us. Rode home from Bexley, shoulder started hurting about 5 miles into the ride. Skipped dinner, had some granola before gym and at midnight. Brother dropped off some bottles and I gave him new beers. Gym productive, increasing bench press weight after stalling. Standing shoulder presses are surprisingly more difficult than seated.

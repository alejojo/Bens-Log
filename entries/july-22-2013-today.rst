10 Hours Previously
-------------------
Stayed up too late reading *Wild Fermentation* and decided at midnight to make a sourdough starter. This morning there were probably about a dozen bubbles, surprisingly.

Morning Ride
------------
Weather was cool this morning. Dense fog covering tall buildings downtown. Some runner waved at me and a homeless person let me pass. Otherwise uneventful and efficient ride. Rested for 10 minutes at destination, only mildly sweaty. Not sore from leg day at gym. Glad today is a rest day.

Evening
-------
Taco and beers at the bar. Had a Bell's Two Hearted and some kind of Imperial IPA. Really pining for a good wheat, but I have those at home I suppose.

Rode to the library to pick up `True Brews` before riding home. Ride home was quite nice. Home just before dark. Finished readig `Wild Fermentation`. Fell asleep watching Star Trek TNG (again).
